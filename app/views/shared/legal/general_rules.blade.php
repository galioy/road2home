                                therefore, R2h does not have any responsibility on whatever could happen before, during
                                or
                                after the trips. People who are taking the trip/s (Both passengers and drivers) are

                                responsible of the results of their behaviors. Although R2h is making its best for

                                safety, taking a trip with in such a way corresponds to hitchhiking, with all the

                        <ol>
                            <li>Your car needs to fulfill all the regulations existing in the country/ies in which you
                                are
                                going to
                                drive; this means that registration and insurance need to be both valid and that the car
                                should be
                                in good running conditions, in order to ensure your hosts the possibility of reaching
                                the
                                desired
                                destination without problems.
                                <br>
                                In particular, it is extremely important that the insurance is valid for all the people
                                staying in the
                                car. In case of an accident, there should not be any problems related to this issue;
                            </li>
                            <li>R2h is not going to pay you for this service, since it is only a website that is
                                connecting
                                people.
                                This means that <u>R2h does not have any responsibilities concerning possible problems
                                    with
                                    the tax
                                    authorities</u>.
                                <br>
                                You have the possibility to choose if charging some money to your host and, if so, how
                                much.
                                This should, however, be agreed PRIOR the departure. Therefore, you should not charge an
                                amount which is too high, just for gaining money. The money given you by your host are
                                just
                                as
                                a contribution for the expenses.
                                <br>
                                It is however important to remember that the main goal of the website is not to make
                                people
                                gain money, but to reduce CO 2 emissions and to allow people to travel in a cheaper way;
                            </li>
                            <li>Your car - your rules: you are more than welcome to set restrictions to the type of
                                hosts
                                you will
                                take, but you have to follow them as well (e.g. if you decide for “no smoking”, than the
                                rule is
                                valid also for you). All the rules for your car should be agreed PRIOR the departure, so
                                your
                                hosts could have the possibility of deciding whether or not to have you as driver.
                                In case you are offering a trip, you could download the R2h calculator, which will
                                suggest
                                you
                                the right price. The price considers only expenses for fuel and maintenance, not those
                                related to
                                other aspects (e.g. motorway); this expenses should be divided among the number of
                                people
                                traveling with the car, but it has to be agreed BEFORE the trip.
                                <br>
                                Although recommended, you do not have to charge the price the R2h calculator will show
                                you;
                                however, you should remember that, with the growth of the community, more people could
                                offer the same trip and your hosts will, of course, choose the cheapest solution.
                                Furthermore,
                                consider that when offering a trip, you should travel that distance anyway; having one
                                or
                                more
                                hosts will already allow you to spare money, so do not focus to much on gaining;
                            </li>
                            <li>In case of mechanical failures (or similar) of your car, you will be the only one who
                                will
                                have to
                                pay for that, unless the failure was due to some incorrect behavior of your hosts;
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        Finally, we ask you for the maximum politeness and respect. After all, our community was build
                        to make it
                        easier for people to travel and help each other.

                                going to be in the same situation as when hitchhiking: the only difference is that we
